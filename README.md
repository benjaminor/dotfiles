# My dotfiles

This is the repository of my personal dotfiles.

Mainly inspired by this [collection](https://github.com/webpro/awesome-dotfiles) on github.

## Install

Run:

```console
$ cd dotfiles && ./deploy_dotfiles.sh
```

This will create a folder dotfiles/bak where you can find your old dotfiles.

Install the necessary or desired packages using the [installation instructions](install_todos.md "TODOs for installation").

## License

See license file.

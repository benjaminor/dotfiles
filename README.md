# My dotfiles

This is the repository of my personal dotfiles.

Mainly inspired by this [collection](https://github.com/webpro/awesome-dotfiles) on github.

My dotfiles are mostly managed by [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) now, part of the code is based on [this repo](https://github.com/mjlbach/nix-dotfiles).
